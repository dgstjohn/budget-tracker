# Budget Tracker -- Online and Offline

## Description

The Budget Tracker app is designed to let the user keep a running count of their monetary income and outflow. It is set up as a progessive web application, enabling the user to perform entries even without any active Internet connectivity. When connectivitiy is re-ewstablished, the entries then update to the live environment. 

As a PWA, the Budget Tracker uses a service worker to enable the offline functionality, as well as indexedDB browser storage to hold the data until it can be added to the database. A MongoDB database handles the data, with live deployment through Heroku [see the link below](#link-to-the-app).
